the datasets(.txt files) in zip file with their dimensions and the variable given in run_analysis.R 

1. features <- features.txt : 561 rows, 2 columns 2. activity_labels <- activity_labels.txt : 6 rows, 2 columns 3. subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column 4. x_test <- X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns 5. y_test <- y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 columns 6. subject_train <- subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column 7. x_train <- X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns 8. y_train <- y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 columns  

2. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 

merging the dataset in done with rbind and cbind below is the list of variable where the instruction is done 

x <- contains the row merge of x_test and x_train by using rbind 

y <- contains the row merge of y_test and y_train by using rbind 

subj <- contains the row merge of subject_test and subject_train by using rbind 

merge_dataset <- contains the column merge of x , y and subj by using cbind 

3. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

mean and std are extracted by contain and select functions below is the variable assigned to 

measurement2 <- from merge_dataset by using select columns subject activity contains("mean") contains("std") are extracted 

4. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 

measurement2$activity <- the column is changed with the columns from activity_labels by using activity_labels[measurement2$activity, 2] 

5. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

the column names is changed used gsub function 

"Acc" is changed into "Accelerometer" 

"Gyro" is changed into "Gyroscope" 

"BodyBody" is changed into "Body" 

"Mag" is changed into "Magnitude" 

"^t" is changed into "Time" 

"^f" is changed into "Frequency" 

"tBody" is changed into "TimeBody" 

"-mean()" is changed into "Mean" 

"-std()" is changed into "Std" 

"-freq()" is changed into "Frequency" 

6. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

the below variable is the final dataset created by using group_by function for grouping activity and subject and summary_all fuction for the average 

FinalData <- from measurement2 group_by is applied to subject activity and summarise_all is used with mean
